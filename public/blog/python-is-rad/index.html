<p>In the last semester of my undergraduate career, I got into the knitty gritty of R Studio thanks to my computational biology and bioinformatics class, and man was it so cool and informative! Within the last bits of the class, I have learned that in programming, softwares like R Studio and Python, are able to talk to each other in chunks with the help of reticulate. Reticulate is accessed through the reticulate package in R. As a future health professional, I thought this was extremely analogical to my future self having a translator to help me out with patients that speak in a language that I’m not familiar with. Essentially, reticulate is like the translator. With reticulate, something like this is how I would introduce myself to my patients:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
one &lt;- &quot;Hello!&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>two = &quot;My name is Dr. Ye,&quot;
three = &quot;and I will be taking care of you today.&quot;
print(r.one,two,three)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Hello! My name is Dr. Ye, and I will be taking care of you today.</code></pre>
<p>To get this greeting, the first thing I did was load the reticulate package in the R code chunk, along with assigning a word to “one”. Then, in the python code chunk, I assigned words to “two” and “three”. To create the phrase, I used the print() function. The r before “one” is meant to allow for the access of R-defined objects.</p>

<p>As my undergraduate college years come to a close, I often find myself looking back at my singing days. In second grade, I remember being in a classroom surrounded by some of my favorite people and soon to be good friends. We would meet up every day after school ended to sing songs out of a booklet our teacher had made us. One of my all time favorites, until this day, has been “Baby Beluga” by Raffi. With some knowledge of python, I thought it would be fun to count the number of times a different character appears in my favorite part of the song:</p>
<p>“Baby beluga in the deep blue sea Swim so wild and you swim so free Heaven above and the sea below And a little white whale on the go”</p>
<p>First, I created a function called count_chars() that can count characters in any string. In other words, it can count characters whenever and wherever.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#create a function that can count characters in any sentence= count_chars
def count_chars(sentence):  #argument will be string object
    counts = {}             #new dictionary
    for c in sentence:      #for each character in sentence
        if c in counts:     #have we seen it before in this sentence?
            counts[c]+=1    #if yes, increase count by 1
        else:
            counts[c]=1     #otherwise, set count
            
    for c in counts:
        print(c, &quot;appears&quot;, counts[c],&quot;times&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then, I applied the count_chars function to my favorite part of “Baby Beluga”, and it went a little like this:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#using count_chars function
new_sentence = &quot;Baby beluga in the deep blue sea, Swim so wild and you swim so free, Heaven above and the sea below, And a little white whale on the go.&quot;
count_chars(new_sentence)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## B appears 1 times
## a appears 10 times
## b appears 5 times
## y appears 2 times
##   appears 28 times
## e appears 18 times
## l appears 7 times
## u appears 3 times
## g appears 2 times
## i appears 6 times
## n appears 6 times
## t appears 6 times
## h appears 5 times
## d appears 5 times
## p appears 1 times
## s appears 5 times
## , appears 3 times
## S appears 1 times
## w appears 6 times
## m appears 2 times
## o appears 7 times
## f appears 1 times
## r appears 1 times
## H appears 1 times
## v appears 2 times
## A appears 1 times
## . appears 1 times</code></pre>
