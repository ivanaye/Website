      <description>In the last semester of my undergraduate career, I got into the knitty gritty of R Studio thanks to my computational biology and bioinformatics class, and man was it so cool and informative! Within the last bits of the class, I have learned that in programming, softwares like R Studio and Python, are able to talk to each other in chunks with the help of reticulate. Reticulate is accessed through the reticulate package in R.</description>

      <description>Introduction  This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contracpetive Prevalence Survey, which examines the effect of a womans demographic and socio-economic characteristics on her contraceptive method choice. The samples are married women who were either not pregnant or did not know if they were pregnant at the time of the interview. There are seven variables. The first is the wife’s age, which is a numerical variable measuring the wife’s age.</description>
